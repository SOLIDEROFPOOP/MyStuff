        <h1>Mexican Oil Reserves</h1>
        <p>Mexico recently completed a new assessment of its oil reserves and estimated proven and probable oil reserves at approximately 18.7 billion barrels. Mexico's earlier assessment in 2007 estimated reserves at approximately 12.4 billion barrels in all country resources, but in 2011, the estimate was revised to 15.7 billion barrels to reflect additional exploration findings. Discoveries in the Sigsbee Field increase this figure by an additional 3 billion barrels.</p>
        <h1>Sigsbee Fields</h1>
        <p>The Sigsbee Field is one of the largest gas and crude oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico, with new advances in seismic imaging and drilling leading to the discovery of this new field. This offshore oil field is located approximately 150 km southeast from the city of Matamoros on the east coast of Mexico in what is often referred to as the "Grand Canyon under the sea." Covering an area 30 by 15 square kilometers (12 by 5.8 sq. mi), the Sigsbee discovery is estimated to contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas and up to 3 billion barrels of liquid crude oil. At its largest point, the field contains a gas column that being drilled in water that is more than 2,000 meters deep. To date, the field has been drilled to a depth of 5,861 meters. Mexico and the United States are involved negotiations to secure access to this source of oil and gas.</p>

        <h1>Four Integral Components</h1>
        <p>The Sigsbee Field is comprised of the following four integral components: Ojeda, Arana, Quiroga, and Orizba.Ojeda Oil and Gas Processing Plant the production, processing and transportation of oil and gas from the field.</p>
        <h1>Ojeda Oil and Gas processing Plant</h1>
        <img src="ojeda.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Oieda is an oil and gas processine plant located 32km (20 mi) northeast of San Fernando. Mexico. The facilitv is 19 km (12 mi) wide and 21 km (13 mi) lone. Constructed in 1989. Oieda is one of the largest crude oil and gas processine plant facilities in Mexico. The citv of San Fernando is the main transport hut Oieda oil from the Gult of Mexico Sigsbee tield to inner-Iving cities within the countr</p>

        <img src="arana.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Aran spar is located on the maritime border between Mexico and the United States, approximately 120 kilometers (75 mi) west of Matamoros. Arana is the second highest producing in the field, behind Quiroga, and is the primary tie-in point connecting the field to Ojeda processing plant. Arana produced 4.6 tons</p>

    <h1>Orizba Rig</h1>
    <img src="orizba.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The Orizba is an ultra deepwater drillship equipped to drill in 3,048 m (10,000 f) of water, situated directly over the deepest part of the valley along which Siesbee field is located. At its largest point, the reservoir contains a gas column 1,450 meters (4,760 f.) deep with a 200 meters (660 f.) deep oil rim below The Orizba is located directlv over this gas colmn. It is estimated the gas colmn contains approximately 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas. and the Orizba is set to produce this gas as well as more than 4 2 tons of crude oil per vea</p>
